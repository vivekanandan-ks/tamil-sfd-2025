# Two ways to open the website:-
Run this in browser(Normal way):
```
https://vivekanandan-ks.github.io/tamil-sfd-2025/
```

Run this in terminal(roundabout nerdy way):
```bash
nix run github:vivekanandan-ks/tamil-sfd-2025
```
This is the equivalent of the follows without polluting your directories. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vivekanandan-ks/tamil-sfd-2025.git
cd tamil-sfd-2025
xdg-open index.html
```

Also like a website, this'll fetch the latest changes from the main branch and do this.

Note: On first run it's a little slow coz it cache. 
Any benefits? Who knows, It's just fun and nerdy
